# Port Management System – Backend

A robust and scalable **Port Management System** built with **Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate (JPA), MySQL**, and cutting‑edge AI integration. The backend automates port operations—order handling, container tracking, expense monitoring, and more—secured via **cookie‑based JWT authentication** and enriched with AI‑driven capabilities.
